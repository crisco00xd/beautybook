# My Project - Backend

This is the backend for the My Project web application, built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- MySQL Server
- A virtual environment (recommended)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_project.git
cd my_project/backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

For Unix-based systems:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

```bash
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@your-db-host:3306/your-db-name
```

Replace `username`, `password`, `your-db-host`, and `your-db-name` with the appropriate values for your MySQL database.

5. Initialize the database:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

6. Run the Flask app:

```bash
python run.py
```

The app will be running on http://localhost:5000.

## Development

To enable debug mode, make sure the `DEBUG` environment variable in your `.env` file is set to `True`. This will provide more detailed error messages and automatically reload the server when code changes are detected.

## Deployment

For deployment, make sure to set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `False` and configure your production MySQL database credentials in the environment variables. Deploy the Flask app to a platform like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or EC2.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Returns a "Hello, world!" JSON message.

Add more API endpoints and their descriptions as needed.
